          <h4>Biography</h4>
          <p class="profile-description">
            Professor Zhao obtained his BEng degree (First Class Honours) from
            Nanchang University in 2010, followed by an MSc and PhD from the
            University of Nottingham in 2011 and 2015, respectively. His
            academic career includes significant positions at Zhejiang
            University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the
            Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of
            Sciences. Professor Zhao’s research focuses on Material
            Intelligence, where he integrates robotics, artificial intelligence
            (AI), and the other data-driven methodologies. His work aims to
            revolutionise traditional material R&D by developing Robotic Factory
            (Hardware), powered by an advanced AI Factory (Software). With over
            100 peer-reviewed publications (citations: 8223, h-index: 52,
            i10-index: 99), Professor Zhao has authored ground-breaking paper
            such as ‘A robotic platform for the synthesis of colloidal
            nanocrystals’ in Nature Synthesis and invited review paper such as
            ‘Data-Driven Materials Innovation and Applications’ in Advanced
            Materials. His research has been funded by various prestigious
            bodies, including: Pioneer Hundred of the Chinese Academy of
            Sciences (Data-Driven Energy Materials Innovation), National Natural
            Science Foundation of China (Robot-assisted Programmable Digital
            Manufacturing of Colloidal Metal Nanocrystals), Pearl River Talents
            of Guangdong Province (Digital and Intelligent Design of
            Nano-Materials), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province
            (Intelligent Manufacturing of Nanocrystal Materials), Shenzhen
            Natural Science Foundation (Robot-assisted Intelligent Manufacturing
            of Semiconductor Materials), Tencent Open Research Fund (Application
            of Machine Learning in Robotic Platforms). Professor Zhao’s research
            has led to the publication of an invited book with Wiley, Material
            Intelligence, and the creation of two IEEE standards: P3466
            (Data-Driven High-throughput Laboratory Intelligence and Automation)
            and P3467 (Digital Manufacturing and Stability Testing of Perovskite
            Solar Cells and Modules). He currently serves as an Editor for
            Artificial Intelligence Chemistry and a Young Editor for InfoMat and
            Results in Engineering. In addition to his academic work, Professor
            Zhao is the founder and chair of the International Conference on
            Data-Driven Materials Innovation and plays an active role in various
            professional societies and standardisation agencies, including the
            IEEE Smart Manufacturing Standards Committee, IEEE SA Regional Group
            of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and the
            Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Standard Innovation
            Alliance. He is also a Registered Senior Standardisation Engineer in
            Hong Kong and Guangdong Province.
